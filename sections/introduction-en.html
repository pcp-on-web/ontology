This domain ontology is a knowledge representation dedicated to investigating a research question which asks for the conditions that were necessary for professors in the early modern university system to attain professional success. Following this premise, the ontology reflects the specifities of academic life in the early modern period in German-speaking countries, focuses on the university professors as a distinctive social group and arranges the existing data accordingly. Decisive for modelling were the structures of the given prosopographic data, data drawn from university and scholarly histories, as well as bibliographical data drawn from databases like VD 16-18 (Bibliography of Books Printed in the German Speaking Countries from 1501-1600, 1601-1700, 1701-1800). As a starting point the project focused on digitized material of the Universities of Leipzig and Helmstedt, which had been two of the most prestigious and most frequented German protestant universities during the early modern period. The vocabulary was linked with common metadata schemes such as DC Terms or the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology (FaBiO) for the description of bibliographical entities. The model is in the final stage of the development process, in which restrictions, cardinalities and intersections are being discussed.
