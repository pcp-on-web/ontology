<h2 id="desc" class="list">Early Modern Professorial Career Patterns - Version 0.2 (pcp-on-web): Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>

<span class="markdown">
Based on the research question and with a practice-theoretical interest, the focus is on the class of the Lecturer as superclass of professors. Various life stages can be assigned that are considered relevant for professorial career paths. In addition to usual prosopographic life stages such as origin, this model also describes entities which provide insight into the socio-cultural entanglements of the actors, in order to give the best possible information about their social (e.g. personal entanglements, memberships), symbolic (degrees, honours, salary certificates), cultural (collections, publications) and economic capital (according to Bourdieu). The aim is to make visible the norm and deviance of practices - as long as the data is available. Complementary to this, the classes of Corporation, Document and Location provide necessary links to classify the respective life stages physically and temporally. Not all concepts have queryable data at the time of the release - digitised archival material from university archives, such as personnel files or faculty council files and the like, is particularly lacking. However, the description of these entities is essential for understanding the domain. It can be assumed that such digital gaps will gradually be filled, for example by digitized research collections belonging to professors which are currently of special research interest. The given model provides several Classes which wait for further description in addition to new datasets.
